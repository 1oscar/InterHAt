    - criteo: https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data
    - avazu: https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge/data
    - MovieLens: http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m-README.html

**Please first run the baselines on criteo (criteoDAC)**
**And then avazu and movielens**

 - where are the datasets?
    ssh to qilin
    ssh to scai1 from qilin
    run `$ cd /local2/zyli/InterpRecSys/data/raw`
    there are three dirs

- baseline repo
    [Model] [Github]: <accomodate input for the model>
    FM: LibFM
- evaluation:
    AUC, LogLoss (Cross Entropy)

- cs account: 
    chenyang@cs.ucla.edu

- How to log in qilin and scai1
    external -> qilin -> feilong
                    -> scai1 (DGX-1)
                    -> scai2 *

    ssh chenyang@qilin.cs.ucla.edu
    X ssh feilong
    ssh scai1

- Models and repos of the baseline models

**If some of these repo don't work well, or raised Errors, feel free 
to switch to other implementations**

1. FM (Factorization Machine):
LibFM: http://www.libfm.org/

2. LR: Logistic Regression 
The competitor used Sibyl (from google but not released)
My suggestion is to try this:
https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/
This is just a suggestion, you may have other solutions.
If not, just skip LR for now.

3. DCN: (Deep&Cross Network), 
   xDeepFM: (Extremely Deep FM), 
   Wide&xDeep
   DeepFM
